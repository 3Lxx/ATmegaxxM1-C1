ATmegaCAN:  Arduino Core for CAN enabled Atmel AVR CPUs
========

Atmel offers a line of CPUs compatible with the CPUs commonly used in Arduino
boards, but that have an additional capability of built in CAN (Control 
Area Network) hardware.  Examples include the ATmega64M1.

ATmegaCAN is an extension to the Arduino IDE environment enabling several of these
CAN containing CPUs.

* Currently supported CPUs include:
** ATmega64M1
** ATmega32M1


Future:
  * Better menu structure
  * Inclusion of ATmega16M1, ATmega32C1, ATmega64C1
  * Clarity around the other AVR CAN CPU:  AT90CANxxx
